#Module3Guide6
This is a website for Module 3, Guide 6. The idea was to create an ice cream website, inspired partly by the Huppa Ice Cream store.
All the buttons on my website are the same style: white, rounded, with pink text inside. All of them are clickable.
I am aware that the ice cream pictures are not the same (unfortunately, it was difficult to find good pictures of Huppa’s ice cream).
The jumping ice cream in the middle was supposed to grab the user’s attention.
Tailwind was used as the UI framework. It felt quite easy to work with, since it allowed me to keep both the CSS and HTML in a single file.
